<!--

## Greetings! 

Hello! As a reader, you're encouraged to submit bug reports to me for errors that you find. In turn I will give you credit for your contributions in not just the e-book but also in the print paperback (once released) and online publicly on the web. This is your opportunity to have your name in my book as a contributor, which you are then welcome to add to your resume and LinkedIn profile. (Note: TODOs are markers to let you know we are going to expand an area, so reporting them during the ALPHA and BETA period **doesn't** qualify as an attributable item.)

Please fill out all the information requested below. Without this, it is very difficult to find out which part of the book and what problem you are facing.
